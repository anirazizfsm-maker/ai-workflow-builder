echo PREPARED SUPPORT MESSAGE:
echo ========================
echo Subject: Certificate Issuance Issue for api.lethimdo.com - Parking Name Servers
echo.
echo Hello Render.com Support,
echo.
echo I'm having issues with SSL certificate issuance for my custom domain api.lethimdo.com. The error message is:
echo "We are unable to issue a certificate for this site. Please see custom domain documentation and verify your DNS records are correct."
echo.
echo Upon investigation, I found that my domain lethimdo.com is currently using parking name servers (ns1.dns-parking.com) instead of my DNS provider's servers (Hostinger). This is preventing proper DNS management and certificate issuance.
echo.
echo I'm in the process of updating the name servers, but this requires 24-48 hours for propagation. In the meantime, could you please help me with one of these options:
echo.
echo 1. Provide the exact TXT record needed for verification so I can add it at the registrar level
echo 2. Manually trigger certificate issuance once I've added the required records
echo 3. Any other workaround to get my certificate issued quickly
echo.
echo My service name is: lethimdo-backend
echo My custom domain: api.lethimdo.com
echo.
echo Thank you for your assistance.
echo.
echo Best regards,
echo [Your Name]
echo.
