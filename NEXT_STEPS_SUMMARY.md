## Next Steps for Cloudflare Pages Deployment

### 1. Connect Your Repository to Cloudflare Pages

1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Sign in to your Cloudflare account
3. Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Create a project"
5. Click "Connect to Git"
6. Connect to GitHub (or your Git provider)
7. Select your repository
8. Click "Begin setup"

### 2. Configure Build Settings

In the "Set up builds and deployments" section:

- **Framework preset**: None (or Vite if available)
- **Build command**: `node ../build-frontend.cjs`
- **Build output directory**: `frontend/dist`
- **Root directory**: Leave empty (should be the root of your repository)

### 3. Add Environment Variables

In the "Environment variables" section, add:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://lethimdo-backend.onrender.com
VITE_APP_NAME=Lethimdo
```

### 4. Deploy Your Application

1. Click "Save and Deploy"
2. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Note the provided `*.pages.dev` URL for testing

### 5. Test Your Deployment

After deployment completes, test these routes with hard-refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R):

- Homepage: `https://your-project.pages.dev/`
- Pricing: `https://your-project.pages.dev/pricing`
- Dashboard: `https://your-project.pages.dev/dashboard`

### 6. Set Up Custom Domains (Optional)

#### For www.lethimdo.com:

1. In Cloudflare Pages dashboard, go to your project
2. Click "Custom domains" tab
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Enter: `www.lethimdo.com`
5. Click "Continue"
6. Cloudflare will show you the CNAME target
7. Go to your DNS provider and add a CNAME record:
   - Name: `www`
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Content: `your-project.pages.dev` (use the exact value Cloudflare provides)

#### For apex domain (lethimdo.com):

1. In Cloudflare dashboard, add your domain `lethimdo.com`
2. Follow Cloudflare's instructions to update nameservers at your registrar
3. Wait for DNS propagation (24-48 hours)
4. Back in Pages project, add `lethimdo.com` as a custom domain

## Quick Deployment Helper

You can run the deployment helper script to verify everything is set up correctly:

- On Windows: Double-click `DEPLOY_TO_CLOUDFLARE.bat`
- On PowerShell: Run `.\DEPLOY_TO_CLOUDFLARE.ps1`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that all required files are present (`wrangler.json`, `build-frontend.cjs`)
2. Verify that the frontend builds locally by running `npm run build` in the frontend directory
3. Ensure environment variables are correctly set in Cloudflare Pages
4. Check that the `_redirects` file exists in `frontend/public/` for SPA routing

## Migration from Netlify

If you're migrating from Netlify:

1. Set up Cloudflare Pages deployment first
2. Test thoroughly using the `*.pages.dev` URL
3. Once confirmed working, update your DNS records
4. After DNS propagation, you can remove the Netlify site
