# Cloudflare Pages Setup Check

## What We Know
1. Your domain nameservers point to Cloudflare
2. You're using Cloudflare for DNS management
3. You have a Cloudflare account (since you deployed to Cloudflare Pages)

## What We Need to Verify
1. Do you have a Cloudflare Pages project for Lethimdo?
2. Are your DNS records correctly configured in Cloudflare?
3. Is your Cloudflare Pages site working?

## How to Check Your Cloudflare Pages Setup

### 1. Access Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Sign in with your Cloudflare account

### 2. Find Your Pages Project
1. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
2. Look for a project named something like "ai-workflow-builder" or "lethimdo"
3. If you don't see it, you may need to create a new Pages project

### 3. Check DNS Records in Cloudflare
1. In Cloudflare Dashboard, select your domain (lethimdo.com)
2. Click on the "DNS" tab
3. Check for these records:
   - A record for "@" (root domain) - should point to Cloudflare Pages
   - CNAME record for "www" - should point to your Cloudflare Pages domain

### 4. Add Custom Domains to Cloudflare Pages
1. In your Pages project, go to "Settings" > "Custom domains"
2. Add both:
   - lethimdo.com
   - www.lethimdo.com
3. Cloudflare will provide the DNS records you need to add

## Required DNS Records for Cloudflare Pages

### For the root domain (lethimdo.com):
```
Type: A
Name: @
Content: 192.0.2.1 (Cloudflare Pages IP for apex domains)
Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
TTL: Auto
```

Or use a CNAME flattening if supported:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Content: your-project.pages.dev
Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
TTL: Auto
```

### For the www subdomain (www.lethimdo.com):
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: your-project.pages.dev (use the exact domain Cloudflare provides)
Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
TTL: Auto
```

## If You Decide to Move to Hostinger

### Steps to Move DNS Management to Hostinger:
1. Get Hostinger's nameservers:
   - Login to Hostinger
   - Go to Domains → lethimdo.com → DNS / Nameservers
   - Note the Hostinger nameservers

2. Update nameservers at your domain registrar (Hostinger):
   - In Hostinger's domain management, change from Cloudflare nameservers to Hostinger nameservers

3. Recreate DNS records in Hostinger:
   - For Cloudflare Pages, you need:
     - CNAME record for `www` pointing to your Cloudflare Pages domain
     - A redirect or CNAME for the apex domain

## Recommendation

Since you're already using Cloudflare Pages for hosting, it's best to keep DNS management in Cloudflare for simplicity. The main thing we need to fix is the missing www subdomain configuration.
