4. Deploy and test using the `*.pages.dev` URL

### Option 2: Quick Verification

3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Use the build settings mentioned above
5. Deploy and test

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

After successful deployment with the `*.pages.dev` URL:

1. Add `www.lethimdo.com` as a custom domain in Cloudflare Pages
2. Add the provided CNAME record to your DNS provider
3. For apex domain (`lethimdo.com`), either:
   - Move DNS to Cloudflare (recommended)
   - Set up a URL redirect from apex to www

## Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check `CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps
2. Verify that all files are present in your repository
3. Ensure the frontend builds locally by running `npm run build` in the frontend directory
4. Contact support if issues persist

## Migration from Netlify

If you're migrating from Netlify:

1. Set up Cloudflare Pages first and test with the `*.pages.dev` URL
2. Once confirmed working, update your DNS records
3. After DNS propagation (24-48 hours), you can remove the Netlify site
