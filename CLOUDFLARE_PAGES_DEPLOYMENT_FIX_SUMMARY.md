# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The Cloudflare Pages deployment was failing with the error:
```
/bin/sh: 1: ../build-frontend.cjs: not found
```

This error occurred because Cloudflare Pages was trying to execute a build command that referenced the build script with an incorrect path.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The [wrangler.json](file:///C:/Users/user/lethimdo/wrangler.json) file had been updated to use the correct path (`node ./build-frontend.cjs`)
2. However, Cloudflare Pages was still using cached settings or reading from a different configuration source
3. The error message showed it was still trying to use `../build-frontend.cjs` instead of the corrected path

## Solution Implemented
We implemented a more robust solution by:

1. **Creating a shell script wrapper** ([build-frontend.sh](file:///C:/Users/user/lethimdo/build-frontend.sh)):
   - Added a shell script that explicitly calls the Node.js build script
   - This approach is more reliable on Cloudflare Pages build environment

2. **Updating [wrangler.json](file:///C:/Users/user/lethimdo/wrangler.json)**:
   - Changed the build command from `node ./build-frontend.cjs` to `bash build-frontend.sh`
   - Kept the correct working directory and output directory settings

3. **Committing and pushing changes**:
   - All changes were committed to the repository
   - Pushed to GitHub to ensure Cloudflare Pages can access the updated configuration

## Files Modified/Added
1. `wrangler.json` - Updated build command
2. `build-frontend.sh` - New shell script wrapper
3. `CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT_TRIGGER_GUIDE.md` - Instructions for triggering new deployment
4. `DEPLOY_TO_CLOUDFLARE.ps1` - Updated PowerShell deployment script
5. `DEPLOY_TO_CLOUDFLARE.bat` - Updated batch deployment script
6. `DEPLOYMENT_README.md` - General deployment documentation

## Next Steps
1. Trigger a new deployment in Cloudflare Pages (see CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT_TRIGGER_GUIDE.md)
2. Monitor the build logs to verify the fix works
3. Test the deployed application thoroughly

## Expected Outcome
The build should now succeed because:
- The shell script approach is more compatible with Cloudflare Pages environment
- The build script path is now explicitly defined and more reliable
- All necessary files are properly tracked in the repository
