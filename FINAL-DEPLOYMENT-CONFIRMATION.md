## ⚠️ OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENT (RECOMMENDED)

While your deployment is working correctly, there is an underlying DNS configuration that could be improved:

### Current Status
- Your domain is using parking name servers (`ns1.dns-parking.com`)
- This works because A records were set at the registrar level
- However, it's not the optimal configuration

### Recommended Action
- Update name servers to Hostinger's DNS servers for better management
- See [DOMAIN-REGISTRAR-UPDATE-GUIDE.md](DOMAIN-REGISTRAR-UPDATE-GUIDE.md) for instructions
- This is optional but recommended for long-term maintenance
