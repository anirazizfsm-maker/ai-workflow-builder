# üö® CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE TROUBLESHOOTING FOR RENDER.COM

## üéØ ISSUE DESCRIPTION
Render.com is unable to issue a certificate for your custom domain `api.lethimdo.com` with the error:
> "We are unable to issue a certificate for this site. Please see custom domain documentation and verify your DNS records are correct. Contact support for assistance if the problem persists for over an hour."

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Based on our DNS analysis, we've identified the underlying issue that's preventing certificate issuance even though your domain appears to be working correctly in some aspects.

### Current DNS Status:
- **Name Servers**: `ns1.dns-parking.com` and `ns2.dns-parking.com` (NOT Hostinger's)
- **Domain Resolution**: Your domain is resolving because A records were likely set at the registrar level
- **API Subdomain**: `api.lethimdo.com` is pointing to Render.com but without proper DNS management

### The Problem:
Your domain is using parking name servers instead of Hostinger's DNS servers. This means:
1. **DNS changes made in Hostinger have no effect** because the domain isn't actually using Hostinger's DNS system
2. **Certificate issuance requires proper DNS management** which isn't available with parking servers
3. **TXT records for verification cannot be properly managed** with the current setup

## üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION: UPDATE NAME SERVERS

### Step 1: Confirm Your Hostinger Name Servers
1. Login to Hostinger: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Go to "Domains" ‚Üí "lethimdo.com" ‚Üí "Manage"
3. Click on "Nameservers" or "DNS / Nameservers" section
4. Note the current name servers (should be):
   ```
   ns1.hostinger.com
   ns2.hostinger.com
   ns3.hostinger.com
   ns4.hostinger.com
   ```

### Step 2: Update Name Servers at Your Registrar
1. Identify where your domain is registered (check purchase emails)
2. Login to your domain registrar's dashboard
3. Find "Nameservers" or "DNS Management" section
4. Replace the current parking name servers with Hostinger's name servers:
   ```
   ns1.hostinger.com
   ns2.hostinger.com
   ns3.hostinger.com
   ns4.hostinger.com
   ```

### Step 3: Wait for Propagation (24-48 hours)
This is the most critical step. DNS changes can take time to propagate globally.

## üîÑ AFTER NAME SERVER PROPAGATION

### Step 1: Reconfigure All DNS Records in Hostinger
Once propagation is complete, you'll need to re-add all DNS records in Hostinger's DNS zone editor:
1. Login to Hostinger: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Go to "Domains" ‚Üí "lethimdo.com" ‚Üí "Manage" ‚Üí "DNS Zone"
3. Add these records (adjust values as needed):

**A Record for root domain:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5  (Netlify IP)
TTL: 3600
```

**CNAME Record for www:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: lethimdo.netlify.app
TTL: 3600
```

**CNAME Record for API:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: api
Value: lethimdo-backend.onrender.com
TTL: 3600
```

### Step 2: Re-add Custom Domain in Render.com
1. Go to Render.com dashboard
2. Navigate to your backend service
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Custom Domains"
4. Remove `api.lethimdo.com` if it exists
5. Wait 5 minutes
6. Add `api.lethimdo.com` again
7. The TXT verification record should now appear

### Step 3: Wait for Certificate Issuance
After successful verification, Render.com will automatically request and install an SSL certificate. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND (IF YOU CAN'T WAIT)

If you need immediate certificate issuance and cannot wait for name server propagation, you can try this workaround by adding the verification records directly at your current registrar level (if supported).

### Option 1: Use Current Registrar for TXT Record
1. Contact your current domain registrar support
2. Request to add a TXT record for `_acme-challenge.api.lethimdo.com` with the value provided by Render.com
3. This requires Render.com support to provide you with the exact TXT record value

### Option 2: Contact Render.com Support
Send this message to Render.com support:

Subject: Certificate Issuance Issue for api.lethimdo.com - Parking Name Servers

Hello Render.com Support,

I'm having issues with SSL certificate issuance for my custom domain api.lethimdo.com. The error message is:
"We are unable to issue a certificate for this site. Please see custom domain documentation and verify your DNS records are correct."

Upon investigation, I found that my domain lethimdo.com is currently using parking name servers (ns1.dns-parking.com) instead of my DNS provider's servers (Hostinger). This is preventing proper DNS management and certificate issuance.

I'm in the process of updating the name servers, but this requires 24-48 hours for propagation. In the meantime, could you please help me with one of these options:

1. Provide the exact TXT record needed for verification so I can add it at the registrar level
2. Manually trigger certificate issuance once I've added the required records
3. Any other workaround to get my certificate issued quickly

My service name is: lethimdo-backend
My custom domain: api.lethimdo.com

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## üß™ VERIFICATION CHECKS

### Check Name Server Propagation:
```bash
nslookup -type=NS lethimdo.com
```
Should show Hostinger's name servers when propagation is complete.

### Check TXT Record:
```bash
nslookup -type=TXT _acme-challenge.api.lethimdo.com
```
Should show the verification record provided by Render.com.

### Check Certificate Status:
Visit https://api.lethimdo.com and check if the browser shows a valid SSL certificate.
