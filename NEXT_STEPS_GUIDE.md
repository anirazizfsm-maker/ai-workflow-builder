Congratulations on successfully deploying your Lethimdo platform! Now that your application is live, here's a comprehensive guide on what to do next to ensure success and continued development.

## Phase 1: Immediate Post-Deployment Actions

### 1. Thorough Testing
Before announcing your application to the world or potential clients, conduct thorough testing:

- **Frontend Testing**:
