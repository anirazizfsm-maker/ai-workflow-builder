# üéØ CERTIFICATE ISSUE SOLUTION SUMMARY

## üìã CURRENT STATUS
Based on our investigation, we've identified the root cause of your certificate issuance issue with Render.com:

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **API Endpoint Access**: https://api.lethimdo.com is accessible and returns 200 OK
2. **SSL Certificate Exists**: A valid certificate is installed (expires Dec 8, 2025)
3. **Health Endpoint**: The backend service is running correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Underlying Issue
Your domain is still using parking name servers (`ns1.dns-parking.com`, `ns2.dns-parking.com`) instead of Hostinger's DNS servers. This creates a conflict where:

1. **Domain Resolution Works**: Because A records were set at the registrar level
2. **Certificate Management Fails**: Because proper DNS management is not available
3. **Render.com Cannot Verify**: The domain properly due to the parking name server setup

## üöÄ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (If Needed Urgently)
1. **Contact Render.com Support** with the following message:
   ```
   Subject: Certificate Issuance Issue for api.lethimdo.com - Parking Name Servers

   Hello Render.com Support,

   I'm having issues with SSL certificate issuance for my custom domain api.lethimdo.com. The error message is:
   "We are unable to issue a certificate for this site. Please see custom domain documentation and verify your DNS records are correct."

   Upon investigation, I found that my domain lethimdo.com is currently using parking name servers (ns1.dns-parking.com) instead of my DNS provider's servers (Hostinger). This is preventing proper DNS management and certificate issuance.

   I'm in the process of updating the name servers, but this requires 24-48 hours for propagation. In the meantime, could you please help me with one of these options:

   1. Provide the exact TXT record needed for verification so I can add it at the registrar level
   2. Manually trigger certificate issuance once I've added the required records
   3. Any other workaround to get my certificate issued quickly

   My service name is: lethimdo-backend
   My custom domain: api.lethimdo.com

   Thank you for your assistance.

   Best regards,
   [Your Name]
   ```

### Phase 2: Permanent Solution (Required)
1. **Update Name Servers**:
   - Login to your domain registrar (where you purchased lethimdo.com)
   - Change name servers from parking servers to Hostinger's servers:
     ```
     ns1.hostinger.com
     ns2.hostinger.com
     ns3.hostinger.com
     ns4.hostinger.com
     ```

2. **Wait for Propagation** (24-48 hours)

3. **Reconfigure DNS Records** in Hostinger:
   - Re-add all DNS records (A record for @, CNAME for www, CNAME for api)

4. **Re-add Custom Domain** in Render.com:
   - Remove and re-add api.lethimdo.com
   - The TXT verification record should appear
   - Certificate should issue automatically

## üß™ VERIFICATION STEPS

### Check Name Server Status:
```cmd
nslookup -type=NS lethimdo.com
```
Should show Hostinger's name servers when complete.

### Check Certificate Status:
```cmd
.\check-ssl-certificate.ps1
```

### Test API Endpoint:
```cmd
curl -I https://api.lethimdo.com/health
```
