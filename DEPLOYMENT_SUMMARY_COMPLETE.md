4. Connect to your GitHub repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `node ../build-frontend.cjs`
   - Build output directory: `frontend/dist`
6. Add environment variables:
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://lethimdo-backend.onrender.com`
   - `VITE_APP_NAME=Lethimdo`
7. Click "Save and Deploy"

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:
1. Run `DEPLOY_AUTOMATION.bat` and select option 2
2. Follow the prompts to log in to Cloudflare and deploy

### Option 3: Create Deployment Package

If you want to create a package for someone else to deploy:
1. Run `DEPLOY_AUTOMATION.bat` and select option 3
2. Share the generated `lethimdo-deployment-package.zip`
