# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Identified
The Cloudflare Pages deployment was failing with the error:
```
/bin/sh: 1: ../build-frontend.cjs: not found
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect build command path in the configuration files. The wrangler.json file was configured to run the build from the frontend directory (`cwd: "frontend"`), but the build command was trying to access `../build-frontend.cjs` which would look for the file in the parent directory of frontend.

Since the build-frontend.cjs file is located in the root directory (not in the parent of frontend), the correct path should be `./build-frontend.cjs` when running from the root directory.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed wrangler.json Configuration
Updated the wrangler.json file to correctly reference the build script:

```json
{
  "pages": {
    "build": {
      "command": "node ./build-frontend.cjs",
      "cwd": ".",
      "output_dir": "frontend/dist"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Documentation
Updated all references to the build command in documentation files:
- CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
- DEPLOYMENT_DASHBOARD.html

## Deployment Configuration Summary

### Cloudflare Pages Settings
When configuring your project in Cloudflare Pages, use these settings:

**Build Settings:**
- Build command: `node ./build-frontend.cjs`
- Build output directory: `frontend/dist`
- Root directory: (leave empty)

**Environment Variables:**
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` = `https://lethimdo-backend.onrender.com`
- `VITE_APP_NAME` = `Lethimdo`

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Updated wrangler.json with correct build command
2. ✅ Updated documentation files with correct paths
3. ✅ Committed and pushed changes to GitHub
4. ✅ Build script (build-frontend.cjs) is in the correct location

## Next Steps

1. Trigger a new deployment in Cloudflare Pages
2. The deployment should now succeed without the "file not found" error
3. Monitor the build logs to ensure the process completes successfully

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter further issues:

1. **Check the build logs** in the Cloudflare dashboard for specific error messages
2. **Verify repository structure** - ensure build-frontend.cjs is in the root directory
3. **Check file permissions** - ensure the build script is executable
4. **Review environment variables** - ensure all required variables are set

## Support

If you continue to experience deployment issues:
1. Refer to the updated CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
2. Check the Cloudflare build logs for detailed error information
3. Contact Cloudflare support with the specific error messages

The configuration has been corrected and the changes have been pushed to your GitHub repository. Your next deployment should succeed.
