# Immediate Next Steps for Your Lethimdo Application

Congratulations again on your successful deployment! Here's what you should do next, organized by priority:

## Priority 1: Verify Your Deployment (Do This First)

### 1. Run the Verification Script
- Double-click on [VERIFY_DEPLOYMENT.bat](file:///C:/Users/user/lethimdo/VERIFY_DEPLOYMENT.bat) in your project folder
- This will check that all necessary files are in place

### 2. Test Your Live Application
- Open your deployed application in a browser
- Test all functionality:
  - Navigation between pages
  - User authentication (if implemented)
  - API connections to backend
  - Form submissions and data display
- Try hard-refreshing (Ctrl+F5) on different routes to verify SPA routing

## Priority 2: Set Up Custom Domains

### 3. Configure www.lethimdo.com
Follow these steps:
1. In Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
   - Go to your project settings
   - Navigate to "Custom domains"
   - Add `www.lethimdo.com`
   - Follow Cloudflare's instructions for DNS configuration

### 4. Set Up Apex Domain (lethimdo.com)
Option A (Recommended for full control):
1. Transfer your domain's nameservers to Cloudflare
2. In Cloudflare Pages, add `lethimdo.com` as a custom domain
3. Cloudflare will automatically configure the apex domain

Option B (Simpler alternative):
1. At your registrar (Hostinger), set up a URL redirect from `lethimdo.com` to `https://www.lethimdo.com`

## Priority 3: Implement Monitoring and Analytics

### 5. Set Up Analytics
Choose one analytics platform:
- Google Analytics (free, comprehensive)
