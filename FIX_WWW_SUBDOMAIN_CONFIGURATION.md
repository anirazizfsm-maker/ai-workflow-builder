# Fix WWW Subdomain Configuration for Cloudflare Pages

Based on our DNS check, your www.lethimdo.com is not configured. This guide will help you fix this issue.

## Current Status

- ✅ Root domain (lethimdo.com) is pointing to Cloudflare
- ❌ WWW subdomain (www.lethimdo.com) is not configured
- ✅ Local build files are present and correct
- ✅ Environment variables are set correctly

## Steps to Fix WWW Subdomain Configuration

### Step 1: Find Your Cloudflare Pages Domain

1. Login to Cloudflare Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Find your project (likely named "ai-workflow-builder")
4. Click on the project name
5. Note the domain shown under "Production" (something like `your-project.pages.dev`)

### Step 2: Add Custom Domain in Cloudflare Pages

1. In your Pages project, click on "Settings" tab
2. Scroll down to "Custom domains" section
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Enter: `www.lethimdo.com`
5. Click "Continue"
6. Cloudflare will show you the DNS record you need to add

### Step 3: Add DNS Record in Cloudflare DNS

1. In Cloudflare Dashboard, select your domain (lethimdo.com)
2. Click on the "DNS" tab
3. Click "Add record"
4. Fill in the details:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Content: [your-project.pages.dev] (use the exact value from Step 2)
   Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
   TTL: Auto
   ```
5. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Configure Root Domain (lethimdo.com)

You also need to ensure your root domain points to your Cloudflare Pages site:

1. In the DNS tab, look for an A record for "@"
2. If it doesn't exist or points to the wrong IP, add/update it:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Content: 192.0.2.1 (This is Cloudflare's IP for apex domains)
   Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
   TTL: Auto
   ```
3. Click "Save"

Alternatively, if Cloudflare supports CNAME flattening for your domain:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @
   Content: [your-project.pages.dev]
   Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
   TTL: Auto
   ```

### Step 5: Wait for DNS Propagation

DNS changes can take some time to propagate:
- Initial processing: 5-15 minutes
- Local propagation: 15-30 minutes
- Global propagation: 1-4 hours

### Step 6: Test Your Configuration

After waiting for propagation:

1. Visit https://www.lethimdo.com
2. Visit https://lethimdo.com
3. Both should load your Lethimdo application

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "www.lethimdo.com's server IP address could not be found"

**Solution:**
1. Double-check the CNAME record in DNS tab
2. Ensure the Content field matches exactly what Cloudflare Pages provided
3. Make sure Proxy status is "Proxied" (orange cloud)

### Issue 2: SSL Certificate Issues

**Solution:**
1. Ensure all DNS records have Proxy status set to "Proxied"
2. Wait for SSL certificate to be issued (can take up to 24 hours)
3. Check the "SSL/TLS" tab in Cloudflare for certificate status

### Issue 3: Mixed Content or HTTPS Issues

**Solution:**
1. Verify that `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your .env file uses HTTPS
2. Check that all external resources use HTTPS
3. Review browser console for mixed content warnings
